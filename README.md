# Plasma-Diagnostics
MATLAB-based optical diagnostic tools studying diffuse plasma. Includes preprocessing and 3D Tomographic Reconstruction scripts

#Shot_Addition

Preprocessing script for Tomography_Loop.
 Increases image contrast through image addition and crops image around the plasma's central axis

#Tomography_Loop

Algorithm developed to create 3D tomographic reconstructions of single-angle plasma images taken using a macro lens

#Vignetting_correction

Developed to apply a vignetting correction mask to images taken using a wide-angle lens, using a modeled vignetting curve
